## Semantic Versioning :mage:s

This project is going to utilize semantic versioning for its tagging.

https://semver.org

The general format:

**MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH**, EG `1.0.1`Â 
Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backward compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backward compatible bug fixes
- Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.
